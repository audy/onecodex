******************************
One Code Python Client Library
******************************

Introduction
============

This package provides 3 major pieces of functionality: (1) a core Python client
library; (2) a simple CLI for interacting with the `One Codex platform
<https://onecodex.com>`_ that uses that core library; and (3) optional
extensions to the client library, which offers many features aimed at advanced
users and provides functionality for use in interactive notebook environments
(e.g., Jupyter notebooks).

For installation instructions and instructions on using the command-line
client, see the :doc:`readme_link`. You can find the source code on `GitHub
<https://github.com/onecodex/onecodex>`_.

Quickstart
==========

For documentation and examples of common uses of the client library including
interactive data analysis and plotting within Jupyter notebooks see
:doc:`Notebooks Demo <notebook_examples/notebooks_demo>`.

API Documentation
=================

For detailed documentation of the Python library, see :ref:`modindex`. For
documentation related to results retrieval, data analysis and plotting
functionality, see :mod:`onecodex.models.collection`.
